# Segunda
Segunda is a student-first marketplace app designed for college communities in the Philippines. Tired of cluttered Facebook groups and irrelevant listings on mainstream platforms? Segunda gives students a trusted, university-exclusive space to buy, sell, and trade second-hand items, dorm essentials, handmade goods, and more.

Built with features tailored to student life—like the "Mine/Steal" reservation system, verified university-only access, and a familiar, mobile-first UI—Segunda makes it easier (and safer) for students to declutter, hustle, and save money.
